# Autoscout24-data-visualisation-and-prediction
 
As part of my Data Science Bootcamp, I programmed a Streamlit app. 
The app visualizes the data from the "Germany Cars Dataset" and evaluates various machine learning models based on it. 
Using the model with the highest explanatory power, the app can generate a prediction for the price of a car. 
The features of the car for which the price is to be predicted can be freely configured.

The underlying dataset is freely available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ander289386/cars-germany/data
Dataset description: Dataset scraped from AutoScout24 with information about new and used cars
